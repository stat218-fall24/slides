# Let's Remember Hypothesis Testing Steps

## 
#### Revising the Steps of Hypothesis Testing 

:::{.callout-important}

1. Construct the Hypotheses of $H_0$ and $H_A$
2. Determine/Identify your $\alpha$ level  
3. __Check the assumptions__
4. Compute test statistic and find the _P_-value (Interpreting R Output)
5. Draw conclusion.

## 
### Assumptions - Verification of Conditions
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- It is always important to check first whether the conditions are reasonable in a given case.
- Here is the list of assumptions that we should be aware of for $t$-tests.

::: fragment
__1) Random Sampling:__ the data can be regarded as coming from independently chosen random sample(s),

__2) Independence of Observations:__ the observations should be independent within each sample, and

__3) Normal Distribution:__ Many of the methods depend on the data being from a population that has a normal distribution.

  - __REMEMBER!__ If sample size is large, then condition (3) is less important (Central Limit Theorem).

## 
### Normality Assumption - I
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
::: {.incremental}

- If the only source of information is the data at hand, then normality can be roughly checked by making a histogram and normal quantile plot of the data.
  
  - Unfortunately, for a small or moderate sample size, this check is fairly rudimentary.
  - If the sample is large, then the visual plots give us good information about the population shape; 
    - However, if $n$ is large, the requirement of normality is less important anyway due to the Central Limit Theorem.
- In any case, a rudimentary check is better than none, and every data analysis should begin with inspection of a graph of the data, with special attention to any observations that lie very far from the center of the distribution.

## 
### Normality Assumption - II

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

We check assumptions before conducting any statistical analysis. To check normality assumption, we need to first check sample size.

- $1^{st}$ option - small samples: Check the $p$-value of Shapiro Wilk test. It is best used with a sample size less than 50 (Shapiro & Wilk 1965; Uttley,2019). 

- $2^{nd}$ option - large samples: Check the visual plots (e.g., histogram, normal quantile plot) if your sample size is more than 50.

### To-Do List Before Start

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Download the assignment and dataset from Canvas.

  - **Mac Users**: Downloading a `.csv` file from Canvas can be tricky. Try opening it in a new tab to download.  
  - **Windows Users:** Congratulations, you are privileged and blessed! Your `.csv` file should download without a fight (hopefully).   
  - **Important**: Even if you manage to download it, please *do not open it* on your computer. Macs sometimes automatically change the file extension (yes, really!), which makes it harder to import with this lab's code.

- Save both files to your `STAT 218` folder (**VERY IMPORTANT**). Otherwise, you won’t be able to import the dataset.
- Ensure your assignment and dataset are in the same folder, with file extensions `.qmd` and `.csv`.
- Follow the instructions on this slideshow to complete the assignment.

## Introduction

<br>

Let's use `library` functions and load the data sets that we will use today.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)
stream_data <- read_csv("Example 8.3.4.csv")
```

##

__IMPORTANT!__: If you don't see `stream_data` in your Environment Pane, this means that your dataset and quarto file are not in the same folder!

![](img/environment.png)

## OR...

You may have downloaded `Example 8.3.4.csv` multiple times, so its name could look like `Example 8.3.4 (2)(1).csv`.

<br>

Check the file name, correct it if necessary, and try again. Remember, R is very stubborn—it won’t read the data if the name doesn’t match exactly what you typed in your code.


## 
__Example of a Case:__ Pollutants in a stream may accumulate or attenuate as water flows down the stream. In a study to monitor the accumulation and attenuation of fecal contamination in a stream running through cattle rangeland, monthly water specimens were collected at two locations along the stream over a period of 21 months.

The data set `stream` the total coliform count (MPN/100ml) for a water specimen.

Perform a __paired samples $t$-test__ to assess whether the mean total coliform count is consistent across the two locations. Use the 5% significance level ($\alpha = 0.05$).


## 
#### Checking the Normality Assumption
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Check your sample size first! 
  - $n$ < 50, so we should check Shapiro-Wilk test.  
  
- Shapiro–Wilk Test is a statistical method that provides a numerical assessment of evidence for certain types of nonnormality in data.

  - The procedure’s mechanics are complex, but statistical software packages simplify the testing process.
Output and Interpretation:

- The output of the Shapiro–Wilk test includes a P-value.
Interpretation:

  - P-value < 0.001: Very strong evidence for nonnormality.
  - P-value < 0.01: Strong evidence for nonnormality.
  - P-value < 0.05: Moderate evidence for nonnormality.
  - P-value < 0.10: Mild or weak evidence for nonnormality.

- _This output is from a calculation of Shapiro-Wilk test. We generally use Shapiro-Wilk test for relatively smaller sample size because visuals can be misleading in smaller sample sizes. Please interpret Shapiro-Wilk $p$-value._

### t_test vs. t.test

- If you notice, we used `t_test()` function last week while conducting independent samples _t_-test by using `infer` package.

- Today, we will use `t.test()` which is available default in R (And some BIO courses use this too). 

- Please pay attention the difference between these two functions.


## 
### Interpreting the Output

```{r}
#| echo: true

# Convert to wide format
wide_data <- stream_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = location, values_from = coliform_count)

```

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}
To be able to conduct paired-samples _t_ test, I changed the structure of data set a little bit.
:::

```{r}
#|echo: false
#|output: true

glimpse(wide_data)
```



## 
### Interpreting the Output

```{r}
#| output: true

# Perform paired t-test
t.test(wide_data$upstream, wide_data$downstream, paired = TRUE)

```
