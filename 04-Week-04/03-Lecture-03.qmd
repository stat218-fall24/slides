### What Did We Learn This Week?
::: {style="font-size: 26px"}

* On Monday,  we explored a method for estimating a confidence interval for a long-run proportion or population proportion. 

  * We found the confidence interval by conducting repeated tests of significance and changing the probability specified by the null hypothesis to see whether or not the hypothesized value was plausible. 
  
* Yesterday, we explored that there are also other ways to approximate a confidence interval. 

  * “Two standard deviation method” (or 2SD method) 
    * The idea of standardization to construct confidence intervals which gives us an approximate 95% confidence interval.  
    * typically based on simulation
* Theory-based approach to generating confidence intervals, 
  * avoids the need to use simulation altogether. 
* allows us to easily use any confidence level we would like, not just 95%.

# CI Methods for a Single Mean

##
### Introduction

* In previous chapters, we were focusing on inferences about a population proportion (categorical variable).   
* Now, we will focus on data consisting of __a single quantitative variable__.  

* We will make inferences about a population mean by creating confidence intervals. 

  * 2SD approach   
  * Theory-based approach  
    * _The probability distribution in this section is called the t-distribution_



# 2 SD Confidence Interval Method for a Single Mean

##

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}


- 2 SD approach should be reasonable as long as the sampling distribution of the sample means is reasonably symmetric. 

  - Previously, when we didn’t know σ (the population standard deviation), we learnt that we could approximate σ/√n with s/√ n.  
  - We also saw that an estimate of the standard deviation of a statistic is often referred to as the standard error.  

::: fragment

The general form of a confidence interval is

$$ 
\\ statistic \pm multiplier \times (SD \ of \ statistic)
$$

Here, our statistic will be the sample mean and multiplier will be 2.

$$ 
\\ \bar{x} \pm 2 \times (s/ \sqrt{n})
$$

# Theory-Based Confidence Interval for a Single Mean

##
### Important Symbols

To distinguish a quantitative variable from a categorical variable, we use different symbols to show population parameters and sample statistics.

__Parameters__

$\mu$ = population mean

$\sigma$ = population standard deviation

__Statistics__

$\bar{x}$ = sample mean

$s$ = sample standard deviation


# Student's _t_ distribution 

## What is _t_ distribution?
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- $t$-distribution is another bell shape and symmetric distribution that can be useful if we do not know anything about population parameters.

- The $t$-distribution is always centered at zero and has a single parameter: __degrees of freedom__.
  - The shape of the distribution depends on the degrees of freedom.

- Broadly speaking, we use $t$-distribution with $df = n − 1$
  - to model the sample mean when the sample size is $n$.
  - As the $df$ is increasing, the $t$-distribution will look more like __the standard normal distribution__ 
    - when the $df$ is about 30 or more, the $t$
-distribution is nearly indistinguishable from the normal distribution.

  y = c(dnorm(x), dt(x, df = 1), dt(x, df = 2), dt(x, df = 4), dt(x, df = 8)),
  Distribution = rep(c("Normal", "df=1", "df=2", "df=4", "df=8"), each = length(x))

### Comparison of _t_ and the Standard Normal Distribution

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Both are symmetric and bell-shaped but $t$-distribution has a larger standard deviation.

- The $t$-distribution has a single parameter: __degrees of freedom__.
- Standard Normal Distribution has two parameters: __$\mu$__ and __$\sigma$__.

# Statistical Estimation

## Statistical Estimation

<br>


- __Statistical estimation__ is a form of statistical inference in which we use the data to 
  (1) determine an estimate of some feature of the population and 
  (2) assess the precision of the estimate.

##

From the sample data we have, we can say that  

- 32.81 is an estimate of __$\mu$__.
- 2.48 is an estimate of __$\sigma$__.

## Statistical Estimation cont.d
::: {style="font-size: 25px"}

We should be aware of the fact that these estimates are subject to sampling error.

::: fragment
::: callout-warning
- This is NOT measurement error; 
  - No matter how accurately each individual butterfly was measured, the sample information is imperfect 
    - due to the fact that only 14 butterflies were measured, rather than the entire population of butterflies.

:::
:::

- Broadly speaking, for a sample of observations on a quantitative variable _X_
  - $\bar{x}$ is an estimate of __$\mu$__.
  - _s_ is an estimate of __$\sigma$__.

And our goal is to estimate __$\mu$__.

- Standar error is the standard deviation of the null distribution.

# Planning a Study to Estimate μ

## Planning a Study to Estimate μ
::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- Before collecting data for a research study, it is wise to consider in advance whether
the estimates generated from the data will be sufficiently precise. 
  - It can be painful indeed to discover after a long and expensive study that the standard errors are so large that the primary questions addressed by the study cannot be answered.

- The precision with which a population mean can be estimated is determined by
two factors: 
(1) the population variability of the observed variable Y, and 
(2) the sample size.

:::

## Planning a Study to Estimate μ

::: {style="font-size: 28px"}

- In some situations the variability of Y cannot, and perhaps should not, be reduced. 
  - For example, a wildlife ecologist may wish to conduct a field study of a natural population of fish; the heterogeneity of the population is not controllable and in fact is a proper subject of investigation.

- On the other hand, it is often appropriate, especially in comparative studies, to
reduce the variability of Y by holding extraneous conditions as constant as possible.
  - For example, physiological measurements may be taken at a fixed time of day; tissue
may be held at a controlled temperature; all animals used in an experiment may be the same age

:::

## What sample size will be needed?

Recall that 

::: fragment
$$
SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
:::

We can use this formula to determine our sample size as follows:

$$
Desired \ SE = \frac{Guessed \ SD}{\sqrt{n}}

- You may wonder how a researcher would arrive at a value such as  $0.4 \ cm^2$ for the
desired SE. Such a value is determined by considering how much error one is willing
to tolerate in the estimate of μ.
